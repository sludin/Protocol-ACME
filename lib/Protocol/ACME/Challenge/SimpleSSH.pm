=head1 NAME

Protocol::ACME::Challenge::SimpleSSH - Challenge handler for simpleHttp via SSH

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Protocol::ACME::Challenge::SimpleSSH;

 my $args = { 'www_root' => "/path/to/htdocs/or/equivalent",
              'ssh_host' => "ssh.example.com" };
 my $challenge = Protocol::ACME::Challenge::SimpleSSH->new( $args );

...

 $acme->handle_challenge( $challenges->{$domain} );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Protocol::ACME::Challenge::SimpleSSH> class is a handler intended
to be run when the ACME script is run on a different machine than the
web server.  It will create the challenge file in the designated location
via SSH.  Note that there is no attempt to escalate privleges so the
location will need to be writabel by the ssh user.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR METHODS

The following constructor methods are available:

=over 4

=item $acme = Protcol::ACME::Challenge::SimpleSSH->new( %options )

This method constructs a new C<Protocol::ACME::Challenge::SimpleSSH> object
and returns it.  Key/value pair arguments may be provided to set up the
initial state. The may be passed in as a hash or a hashref. The following options
correspond to attribute methods described below. Items markes with
a * are required.

   KEY                     DEFAULT
   -----------             --------------------
   *www_root               Path to web root that will handle the HTTP
                           challenge
   *ssh_host               Hostname of the web server for ssh access
