=head1 NAME

Protocol::ACME::Challenge::LocalFile - Challenge handler for simpleHttp via a local file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Protocol::ACME::Challenge::LocalFile;

 my $args = { 'www_root' => "/path/to/htdocs/or/equivalent" };
 my $challenge = Protocol::ACME::Challenge::LocalFile->new( $args );

...

 $acme->handle_challenge( $challenges->{$domain} );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Protocol::ACME::Challenge::LocalFile> class is a handler intended
to be run when the ACME script is run on the same local machine as the
web server.  This is a logical choice to use for self contained web
server / Let's Encypt integration.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR METHODS

The following constructor methods are available:

=over 4

=item $acme = Protcol::ACME::Challenge::LocalFile->new( %options )

This method constructs a new C<Protocol::ACME::Challenge::LocalFile> object
and returns it. Key/value pair arguments may be provided to set up the
initial state. The may be passed in as a hash or a hashref. The following
options correspond to attribute methods described below. Items markes with
a * are required.

   KEY                     DEFAULT
   -----------             --------------------
   *www_root               path to web root that will handle the HTTP
                           challenge

=head2 METHODS

=over

=item handle( $challenge, $fingerprint )

This is intended to be called indirectly via the ACME driver class.
C<handle> will take care of all of the conditions necessary to satisfy
the challenge sent by Let's Encrypt.

=item cleanup

C<cleanup> will remove the challenge file.
