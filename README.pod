=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Protocol::ACME> is a class implementing an interface for the
Let's Encrypt ACME API.

NOTE: This code at this point is functional but should be considered
'alpha' quality.

The class handles the protocol details behind provisioning a Let's
Encrypt certificate.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR METHODS

The following constructor methods are available:

=over 4

=item $acme = Protcol::ACME->new( %options )

This method constructs a new C<Protocl::ACME> object and returns it.
Key/value pair arguments may be provided to set up the initial state.
The may be passed in as a hash or a hashref. The following options
correspond to attribute methods described below. Items markes with
a * are required.

   KEY                     DEFAULT
   -----------             --------------------
   *host                   undef
   account_key             undef
   account_key_format      PEM
   ua                      undef

=head2 METHODS

=over

=item load_key( $key_filename, $key_format )

Load a key from disk.  Currently the key needs to be unencrupted.
Callbacks for handling password protected keys are still to come.
C<$key_format> is either PEM or DER with PEM as the default.

=item directory()

Loads the directory from the ACME host.  This call must be made first
before any other calls to the API in order the bootstrap the API
resource list.

=item register()

Call the new-reg resource and create an account associated with the
loaded account key.  If that key has already been registered this method
will gracefully and silently handle that.

=item accept_tos()

In order to use the Let's Encrypt service, the account needs to accept
the Terms of Service.  This is provided in a link header in response
to the new-reg ( or reg ) resouce call.  If the TOS have already been
accepted as indicated by the reg structure returned by the API this
call will be a noop.

=item authz( $domain )

C<authz> needs to be called for each domain ( called identifiers in
ACME speak ) in the certifcate.  This included the domain in the subject
as well as the Subject Alternate Name (SAN) fields.  Each call to
C<authz> will result in a challenge being issued from Let's Encrypt.
These challenges need to be handled individually.

=item handle_challenge( $challenge_object )

C<handle_challenge> is called for each challenge issued by C<authz>.
The challenge object must be a subclass of C<Protocol::ACME::Challenge>
which implements a 'handle' method.  This objects handle method
will be passed three arguments and is expected to fulfill the
preconditions for the chosen challenge.  The three areguments
are:

  fingerprint: the sha256 hex digest of the account key
  token: the challenge token
  url: the url returned by the challenge

Fully describing how to handle every challenge type of out of the
scope of this documentation ( at least for now ).  Two challenge
classes have been included for reference:

C<Protocol::ACME::Challenge::SimpleSSH> is initialized with the
ssh host name and the www root for the web server for the http-01
challenge.  It will ssh to the host and create the file in
the correct location for challenge fulfillment.

C<Protocol::ACME::Challenge::LocalFile> is initialized with just the
www root for the web server for the http-01 challenge.  It will
simply create the challenge file in the correct place on the local
filesystem.

C<Protocol::ACME::Challenge::Manual> is intended to be run in an
interactive manner and will stop and prompt the user with the relevant
information so they can fulfill the challenge manually.

but below is an example for handling the simpleHTTP ( http-01 )
challenge.


=item check_challenge()

Called after C<handle_challenge>.  This will poll the challenge status
resource and will return when the state changes from 'pending'.

=item $cert = sign( $csr )


Call C<sign> after the challenge for each domain ( itentifier ) has
been fulfilled.  C<$csr> is the DER encoded Certificate Signing
Request ( CSR ).  On success Let's Encrypt will return the DER encoded
signed certificate.
